3. REQUIREMENTS
• Requirement Analysis
From the given scenario, we draw the following requirements:
The "Birdie Bounce" project involves developing a Java-based game inspired by "Flappy Bird." To successfully create this game, several fundamental requirements must be considered.
Firstly, the project necessitates a robust development environment. This includes the latest version of Java Development Kit (JDK) to write and run Java code, as well as a suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for efficient coding and debugging.
The game's graphical elements require Java libraries or frameworks like LibGDX or JavaFX to handle rendering, animations, and user interface components. These libraries enable the creation of a visually appealing and responsive gaming experience.
Incorporating game physics and collision detection is essential for the bird's movement and obstacle interactions. Understanding and implementing these mechanics is crucial for a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
User input and controls form another vital requirement. The project should allow players to control the bird's movement using simple and intuitive commands, typically achieved through keyboard input or screen taps for mobile platforms.
Moreover, the project should include a scoring system to track and display players' progress, along with a game over mechanism triggered when the bird collides with obstacles or falls to the ground. High scores should be stored and updated accordingly, and a leaderboard feature can be added for competitive play.
In summary, the "Birdie Bounce" project requires a well-equipped development environment, appropriate Java libraries, physics and collision detection implementation, user-friendly input controls, scoring and game over mechanics, and optional leaderboard functionality to create an entertaining and challenging game experience.
• Hardware Requirement
The hardware requirements for running and developing the "Birdie Bounce" game in Java are relatively modest, as Java is known for its platform independence. Here are the basic hardware requirements:
1. Computer: Any modern computer or laptop should be sufficient for both running and developing a Java game like "Birdie Bounce."
2. Processor (CPU): A multi-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i3 or equivalent) is recommended for smoother performance, especially during development and testing.
3. Memory (RAM): At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for game development. More RAM may be beneficial for running other software alongside the game development environment.
4. Graphics Card: A standard integrated graphics card should be sufficient for developing and playing 2D Java games. If you're planning to include complex 3D graphics, you may need a dedicated graphics card.
5. Storage: A typical hard drive or SSD with sufficient storage space for your development environment, code, and game assets.
6. Monitor: A standard monitor with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels is recommended for game development.
7. Input Devices: A keyboard and mouse for development, and you may need a touch- sensitive device (e.g., touchscreen or touchpad) for testing if you are developing for touch- based input.
8. Sound: Basic audio output for testing the game's audio effects.

   4. IMPLEMENTATION
Game Concept:
The Birdie Bounce game is a simple game where a bird bounces when the player clicks or taps the screen. The goal is often to keep the bird bouncing upward, avoiding the ground.
Key Elements: Bird:
• Represented as a circular object on the screen.
• Bounces upward when an input event (e.g., mouse click) is detected. Gravity:
• A force that pulls the bird downward, creating a bouncing effect.
• Simulated by adjusting the bird's vertical position over time.
Implementation Steps:
Setup the Game Window:
• Create a Java Swing application to serve as the game window.
• Set up the necessary parameters such as width, height, and close operation.
Initialize Variables:
• Define variables for the bird's position, velocity, gravity, and any other relevant game parameters.
Mouse Input Handling:
• Implement mouse input handling to detect when the player clicks.
• When a click is detected, make the bird bounce by adjusting its velocity.
Game Loop:
• Implement a game loop using a javax.swing.Timer or another mechanism.
• Inside the loop, update the bird's position based on its velocity and simulate gravity.
Collision Detection:
• Check for collisions with the ground or other game elements.
• Adjust the bird's position and velocity accordingly to handle collisions.
Rendering:
• Override the paint method to render the bird on the screen.
• Use graphics operations to draw the bird at its current position.
Run the Game:
• Create an instance of the game window and make it visible.
• Start the game loop to continuously update and render the game.
Additional Considerations:
Scoring System:
• Implement a scoring mechanism to track the player's performance.
Obstacles:
• Introduce obstacles that the bird must avoid while bouncing.
Background and Graphics:
• Enhance the visual appeal by adding a background and using more sophisticated graphics.
Sound Effects:
• Include sound effects for events like bouncing or scoring.
Game Over Conditions:
• Implement conditions that lead to a game over, such as hitting an obstacle or falling to the ground.
User Interface:
• Create a user interface for displaying the score and other relevant information.

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
